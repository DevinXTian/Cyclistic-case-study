# Cyclistic-case-study

This is a case study from Google's Data Analytics Certificate.

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## About Cyclistic

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-sharing offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unloacked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## PHASE 1: ASK
Key Objectives:
1. Identify the key stakeholders:
- Lily Moreno (director of marketing), marketing analytics team, executive team (decide whether to approve recommendations)
2. Define the business tasks:
- Maximize number of memberships
- Create marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members
3. Questions to answer:
- How do annual riders and casual riders use the bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy annual membership?
- How can the company use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## PHASE 2: PREPARE
1. Identify the data source:
- Public Cyclistic data sets (licensed under Motivate International Inc.)
- Most recent 12 months used (01/2023 to 02/2022)
2. Determine the credibility of the data source, I will use the ROCCC approach.
- Reliability: MED - This data comes from the company, so it should be fairly reliable.
- Original: HIGH - This data is gathered by the company directly.
- Comprehensive: MED - This data provides a wide variety of useful information but does not have any information on the demographic
- Current: HIGH - This data is from the most recent 12 months.
- Cited: LOW - Unknown.
This data source is fairly reliable and can be used for high-level insights and recommendations.

## PHASE 6: ACT

### Key insights
1. Casual riders, on average, ride for longer periods of time and for slightly longer distances. Also, they ride more on the weekends, while members ride more on work days such as Tues, Wed, and Thurs.
2. Casual riders prefer electric bikes the most, while there does not seem to be much of a preference for either classic or electric bikes for members.
3. Summer months are the most popular times for bike riding, while winter months are the least popular.

### Recommendations for marketing strategy
1. Promote a rewards program or have some incentive for using electric bikes if you are an annual member
- Casual members prefer using this type of bike, so they would be more willing to switch in exchange for benefits.
2. Have special perks for those who ride for a certain time length if you are an annual member
3. Advertise heavily in the summer and can have advertising campaigns/billboards near the more popular bike riding stations, especially near Streeter Dr & Grand Ave. This station is the most popular starting station by far for casual riders and provide a lot of awareness for the benefits of becoming an annual member.

### Additional relationships I could have looked at:
1. scatterplot to see correlation between bike type and ride length (potentially tells me if people prefer using one bike over the other for longer distances)
2. see which months are the most popular for riding (can have more ads run at this time)
